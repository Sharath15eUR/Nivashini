How the Linux Kernel Supports Ethernet Communication
The Linux kernel provides robust support for Ethernet communication through its networking stack, device drivers, and protocol handling mechanisms.

1. Network Interface and Drivers

The kernel interacts with Network Interface Cards (NICs) using device drivers.
Ethernet drivers are part of the kernel's netdev subsystem and handle low-level packet transmission.

You can check active interfaces using:
ip link show

Common Ethernet drivers include:

e1000 (Intel Ethernet)
r8169 (Realtek Ethernet)

2. Network Stack and Packet Processing

The Linux network stack follows the OSI model, handling data from the physical layer (Ethernet) to the application layer.
It processes incoming and outgoing packets via:

netif_rx() – Handles received packets.

dev_queue_xmit() – Sends packets.

The kernel also supports interrupt-based processing for high-performance networking.

3. Ethernet Frame Handling

The kernel processes Ethernet frames (Layer 2) by extracting:
MAC addresses (Source/Destination)
EtherType (IPv4, IPv6, ARP, etc.)

Payload Data
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses.

4. Packet Filtering & Routing

The Linux kernel uses netfilter (iptables) for packet filtering.

Routing is managed via:

ip route show
The kernel supports bridging, VLANs, and bonding for advanced networking.

5. Kernel Modules for Ethernet

Ethernet support is modular, with kernel modules (.ko files) loaded dynamically.

You can check loaded Ethernet drivers using:

lsmod | grep net
Modules can be manually loaded with:

modprobe <module_name>

Conclusion:
The Linux kernel enables Ethernet communication through a modular driver system, network stack, packet processing, and routing mechanisms, ensuring efficient data transfer.
